# Example for Arduino usage
## Prerequisites

To build the code for Arduino, we use this [library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/irremote/) from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). A tutorial on how to add the library to your Arduino IDE can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

## Usage

Simply follow the connection diagram below and you can start sending IR codes!

| BTN3 | A1 |
| BTN2 | A2 |
| BTN1 | A3 |
| LED | 3 |
| 3.3V | 3.3V |
